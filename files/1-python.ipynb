The main APIs are [Scala](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.package) and [Java](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/index.html) APIs, as Spark is implemented in Scala and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\nSince the 0.7.0 version, a [Python API](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) is available, also known as PySpark. An [R API](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/index.html) has been released with 1.5.0 version. During this course, you will be using Spark 2.2.\n\nThroughout this course we will use the Python API for the following reasons:\n- R API is still too young and limited to be relied on. Besides, R can quickly become a living hell when using immature libraries.\n- Many of you are wanabee datascientists, and Python is a must-know language in data industry.\n- Scala and Java APIs would have been quite hard to learn given the length of the course and your actual programming skills.\n- Python is easy to learn, and even easier if you are already familiar with R.\n\nThe goal of this session is to teach (or remind) you the syntax of basic operations, control structures and declarations in Python that will be useful when using Spark. Keep in mind that we do not have a lot of time, and that you should be able to create functions and classes and to manipulate them at the end of the lab. If you don't get that, the rest of the course will be hard to follow. Don't hesitate to ask for explanations and/or more exercises if you don't feel  confident enough at the end of the lab.\n\n**Note:** Python comes in two flavours, Python 2 and Python 3. For some reasons, the two versions coexist today. However, Python 2 is reaching end of life and will stop being maintained in 2020. However, the default python version used in many production systems and companies is Python 2. That is why this course will use Python 2 rather than Python 3. Note that if you know Python 2, learning Python 3 will be lightning-fast.\nFor those who are interested, you can quickly learn Python 3 syntax [over here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/) or find some [cheatsheets](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/promotions/python/python2python3.pdf) highlighting the differences between the two versions. Spark Python API is compatible with Python 3 since Spark 1.4.0.\n\n*This introduction relies on [Learn Python in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)*\n\n## Introduction\n\nPython is a high level, general-purpose interpreted language.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) can be a very powerful paradigm. If done well, OOP  allows you to improve the modularity and reusability of your code, but that's the subject of an entire other course. \nHere is a *very* short introduction to it.\n\nBy convention, class names are written in camel case, e.g. `MyBeautifulClass`, while variable and function names are written in snake case, e.g. `my_variable`, `my_very_complex_function`\n\nClasses contain methods (i.e. functions owned by the class) and attributes (i.e. variables owned by the class). \nWhen you define a class, first thing to do is to define a specific method, the constructor.
